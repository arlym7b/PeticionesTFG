## NaryRandomSelection
### Petición
```
This is the implementation for the RandomSelection Operator in Java:
@SuppressWarnings("serial")  
public class RandomSelection<S> implements SelectionOperator<List<S>, S> {  
  
  /** Execute() method */  
  public S execute(List<S> solutionList) {  
    Check.notNull(solutionList);

    List<S> list = ListUtils.randomSelectionWithoutReplacement(1, solutionList);  
  
    return list.get(0) ;  
  }
}

This is how it is implemented in Julia:
struct RandomSelectionOperator <: SelectionOperator
end

function select(x::Vector, selectionOperator::RandomSelectionOperator)
  return x[rand(1:length(x))]
end

And this is the implementation for NaryRandomSelection Operator in Java:
@SuppressWarnings("serial")  
public class NaryRandomSelection<S> implements SelectionOperator<List<S>, List<S>> {  
  private int numberOfSolutionsToBeReturned;  
  
  /** Constructor */  
  public NaryRandomSelection() {  
    this(1);  
  }  
  /** Constructor */  
  public NaryRandomSelection(int numberOfSolutionsToBeReturned) {  
    this.numberOfSolutionsToBeReturned = numberOfSolutionsToBeReturned;  
  }  
  /** Execute() method */  
  public List<S> execute(List<S> solutionList) {  
    Check.notNull(solutionList);  
    Check.collectionIsNotEmpty(solutionList);  
    Check.that(  
        solutionList.size() >= numberOfSolutionsToBeReturned,  
        "The solution list size ("  
            + solutionList.size()

    return ListUtils.randomSelectionWithoutReplacement(

The error you're encountering stems from the fact that you're passing keyword arguments (`matingPoolSize`, `solutionIndexGenerator`, etc.) to the constructor of the `PopulationAndNeighborhoodSelection` struct, but the constructor isn't defined to accept keyword arguments.
